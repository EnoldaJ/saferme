## 1. Purpose

To develop a **personal AI healthcare advocate** that empowers underrepresented and underserved patients to confidently navigate the healthcare system. The AI will support inclusive communication, provide personalized health education, and reduce disparities through equitable, bias-aware interactions—ensuring no one feels alienated or misunderstood in their care journey.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Patients from minority backgrounds often encounter barriers in healthcare settings: language differences, cultural disconnects, systemic bias, and a lack of representation in care delivery. These issues lead to reduced trust, miscommunication, and health inequities.

---

## 3. Objectives

- Eliminate communication barriers between patients and providers.
- Detect and reduce implicit bias in healthcare interactions.
- Ensure all patients—regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, disability, or language—feel seen, heard, and empowered.
- Promote informed decision-making through culturally relevant education.

---

## 4. Target Users

- Black, Hispanic/Latine, Indigenous, Asian, immigrant, and LGBTQ+ patients
- Neurodiverse individuals and those with disabilities
- Caregivers supporting marginalized populations
- Patient advocates and community health workers

## 5. Key Features (Inclusive by Design)

| Feature                       | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Bias Monitoring & Response Engine** | Uses NLP to detect biased, dismissive, or invalidating language in real-time. Provides patient-centered reframing, suggestions for clarifying questions, and data to inform systemic improvements. |
| **Accessible Language Mode** | Offers health education in plain language and local dialects, with visual, auditory, and multilingual support (e.g., screen reader, ASL integration, and alt text). |
| **Cultural Context Layer** | Adapts content to reflect the user’s culture, values, and health beliefs (e.g., dietary practices, family dynamics, community norms). |
| **Pre-Visit Empowerment Toolkit** | Suggests patient-specific questions and rights-based prompts to prepare for appointments and voice concerns without fear of being dismissed. |
| **Ally Alerts for Providers** *(optional feature)* | Notifies clinicians—via opt-in—about potential communication disconnects or suggestions for culturally sensitive engagement. |
| **Privacy & Trust Safeguards** | Users control what is stored or shared. All interactions are encrypted, and users can erase history at any time. |
| **Gender and Identity Sensitivity** | Avoids assumptions about identity, pronouns, or relationships. The AI respects self-described attributes without imposing defaults. |
